It completely defines you, separates you from those in the states. There are a million different ways to look at things.\u201d BM\u2019s most meaningful experiences were getting to travel to many places, living in other cultures, independence, and speaking other languages.

Teachers were not welcoming to (curriculum) options other than what was written in textbooks. They did not use students as curriculum resources in learning. In the younger grades, I did not understand what was going on. But by eighth grade, I realized\nthat in general \u201csomething was missing\u201d in my (U.S.) schooling experiences.
