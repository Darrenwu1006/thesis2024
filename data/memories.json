   "content": "There is this cultural difference coming from overseas to the United States for schooling (as a TCK). You experience a lot of stereotypes. From my experiences in U.S. schools, teachers did not use my overseas experiences as lessons in the classrooms. There was an ignorance from teachers (particularly in high school) about cultures, especially Asian, and stereotypes of those cultures. Teachers were not welcoming to (curriculum) options other than what was written in textbooks. They did not use students as curriculum resources in learning. In the younger grades, I did not understand what was going on. But by eighth grade, I realized\nthat in general “something was missing” in my (U.S.) schooling experiences. I suppose a lot depends on the demographics of the school, community and teachers’ backgrounds as well as teachers’ knowledge of their students. Growing up in this (TCK) life and building trust with teachers is so important.",
