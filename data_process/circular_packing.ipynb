A lot of Asian Americans are trying to break away from this by pursuing diverse interests, such as sports or creative hobbies. Some parents often encouraged us to excel in school, specifically in math, science, or musical instruments like piano or violin. This expectation sometimes restricts many Asian Americans from exploring other creative outlets. As we grow up, we start to realize the variety of things we can do. For me, it was sports like running and basketball. There are so many opportunities available nowadays for self-exploration and breaking stereotypes.',\n",

Even though we don't play as much now, we remain close. Part of this closeness is due to our shared love for basketball, a common language that brought us together. Following sports teams like the Washington Wizards also exposed me to other sports such as baseball, football, and soccer. Engaging in these Americanized sports helped me better adjust to the culture around me and resonate more with kids growing up in the same environment.\",\n",

From my experiences in U.S. schools, teachers did not use my overseas experiences as lessons in the classrooms. There was an ignorance from teachers (particularly in high school) about cultures, especially Asian, and stereotypes of those cultures. Teachers were not welcoming to (curriculum) options other than what was written in textbooks. They did not use students as curriculum resources in learning. In the younger grades, I did not understand what was going on. But by eighth grade, I realized\\nthat in general “something was missing” in my (U.S.) schooling experiences. I suppose a lot depends on the demographics of the school, community and teachers’ backgrounds as well as teachers’ knowledge of their students. Growing up in this (TCK) life and building trust with teachers is so important.',\n",

       "  'content': '\"Some background. I came to the states without any knowledge of engish and neither did my parents. It was some midwestern state in the early 1990s. In the school, there were 3 asians, and 1 black kid. From the very first episode to episode 8. I felt like my life was shown. I had the same infatuation with hiphop. My first album was Straight Outta Compton. PE and Ice Cube and Ice T were my favorite groups. I felt exactly as the series describe, it\\'s not that the white folks were disrespectful to me (in fact there where at the beginning), but they just don\\'t know what to do with a person of different race and culture. I could never truly be in the \"in crowd\". I found commonality in people who are different and music that\\'s different, and most hiphop at that time was portraying rebellion against the establishment. To me, the establishment was white with Christian morales. That\\'s not what I am about. I had 3 Asian kids in school who are straight A and musicians. I ain\\'t about that nonsense. All through school, my best friend was a black kid and he was the one that introduced me to straight outta compton.\"',\n",
