Instead of conventional gifts, we received red envelopes on birthdays and holidays. These occasions were often marked by cooking and enjoying food together. My dad, a restaurant chef, had a passion for cooking. He often tried new recipes, resulting in a plethora of home-cooked Chinese meals. To me, the meanings of red envelope vary by location, but it's largely about good luck, health, and positive energy. Receiving it from parents, uncles, aunts, or grandparents feels significant. To boil it down, it signifies good health, luck, and positive energy.\",\n",

Growing up in the states, having an older brother who had gone through things first was beneficial. He provided inspiration and a roadmap. With our parents being immigrants from China, they had less understanding of the education system here. However, having an older brother who went through it before me provided insights that helped me navigate school and my career after graduation.\",\n",

From my experiences in U.S. schools, teachers did not use my overseas experiences as lessons in the classrooms. There was an ignorance from teachers (particularly in high school) about cultures, especially Asian, and stereotypes of those cultures. Teachers were not welcoming to (curriculum) options other than what was written in textbooks. They did not use students as curriculum resources in learning. In the younger grades, I did not understand what was going on. But by eighth grade, I realized\\nthat in general “something was missing” in my (U.S.) schooling experiences. I suppose a lot depends on the demographics of the school, community and teachers’ backgrounds as well as teachers’ knowledge of their students.

It can be hard to connect with my dad, but he's improving his emotional intelligence. Many Asian families can relate to a parent commenting on their appearance. Having a game like this was a buffer for us, showing our love for each other in a non-verbal way. My parents don't tell me they love me or that they're proud of me. They're not used to that kind of language. We don't really hug or kiss. Playing games was a moment where we all came together, spending quality time. Movies like Crazy Rich Asians, despite not being a cultural movement, were significant. \",\n",

It's not an isolated identity crisis, but rather a universal phenomenon. Many Asian Americans share similar experiences and upbringings. You start to see patterns and realize that others have had similar journeys. These reflections often happen during high school or college when you question your identity and upbringing.

       "  'content': 'There is this cultural difference coming from overseas to the United States for schooling (as a TCK). You experience a lot of stereotypes. From my experiences in U.S. schools, teachers did not use my overseas experiences as lessons in the classrooms. There was an ignorance from teachers (particularly in high school) about cultures, especially Asian, and stereotypes of those cultures. Teachers were not welcoming to (curriculum) options other than what was written in textbooks. They did not use students as curriculum resources in learning. In the younger grades, I did not understand what was going on. But by eighth grade, I realized\\nthat in general “something was missing” in my (U.S.) schooling experiences. I suppose a lot depends on the demographics of the school, community and teachers’ backgrounds as well as teachers’ knowledge of their students. Growing up in this (TCK) life and building trust with teachers is so important.',\n",
